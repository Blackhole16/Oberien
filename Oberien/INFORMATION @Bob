I have internet but just very bad one (8-20kB/s)
I'll completely overwork my model because I think that it is easier for both of us to just have the Class Model with all different attributes. Than I'll do an enum Type with values like "infantry, tank, recon, building" etc. Every unit having 0 atk cant attack at all and every unit having movespeed==0 is an building.
Next I would like you to add a mapchooser (atm I just have that silly JOptionPane in View). Therefore I will try to write a kind of an ScrollPane.
Next (or better before the mapchooser (bc you dont have the scrollpane yet) you can program the HUDRenderer. Just write an own class. I structered it so the scaling is done in the GameRunning.render() and after the scaling all renderer are called. The renderer can just draw in original size and don't have to do anything with the scaling!!!
After that you can start with the StartMenu or EscMenu.

I hope you understand my changes and you can just program on. In this file we just add all pooints and questions, bc I don't have skype here, I just have this commits :)
